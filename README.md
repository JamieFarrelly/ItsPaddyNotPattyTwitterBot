# Its Paddy Not Patty Twitter Bot

*Correcting people one tweet at a time, because there's a difference between a burger and a person.*

It's Paddy not Patty is a fun little Twitter bot that corrects people who use St. Patty instead of St. Paddy (Sure, St. Patrick is more correct, but not as fun!).

Every couple of hours or so it searches for new tweets that mention St. Patty and then corrects them. View it [here on Twitter](https://twitter.com/PaddyNotPattyOK)
